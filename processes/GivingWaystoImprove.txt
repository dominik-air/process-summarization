Offer constructive criticism. Do not just tell the person what they are doing wrong. Constructive criticism means that you also need to provide some ideas on how they can improve. Tell them what they are doing wrong, then tell them how to fix it.
Be direct. Do not try to dodge the issue. Get straight to the point. After your positive statement, deliver the feedback in clear, straightforward terms.
Be brief. Don’t ramble on. Your statement should be direct, and it should also be brief. You’ll be able to follow up on the issue later. During the feedback sandwich, keep it short so that your message is easy to understand.
Give clear guidelines. The point of giving feedback is to help the other person succeed. Avoid telling them vaguely what you need from them. Instead, give specific goals to meet.
