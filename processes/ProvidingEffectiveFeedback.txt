Be objective. Avoid using “I” statements. These are things like “I don’t like how you did this” or “I feel like you are not trying”. Instead, use actual facts to support the points you are making. Say, “You have not turned in the past three assignments. That demonstrates a lack of commitment to this class.”
Focus on the situation instead of the person. Leave your personal feelings out of it. Sure, you might feel some negativity towards the other person, or maybe you just don’t click. Don’t let that inform the criticism that you are giving.
Give task specific suggestions. Try to avoid giving vague suggestions for improved performance. Something like, “You need to do better” is not really helpful. Instead, talk about the actual thing that needs improvement.
Give timely feedback. Try to give your feedback when it can still be helpful. If you wait until you are completely dissatisfied, there might not be much time left to salvage the situation. If you notice a problem, address it quickly. If given correctly, your feedback could help the other person improve.
