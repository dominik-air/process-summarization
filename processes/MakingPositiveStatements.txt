Start with a compliment. Begin the conversation by saying something positive to the other person. You want to start this talk on a positive note. It will help keep the other person from becoming defensive.
Be specific. Make sure that your compliment is not vague. That might leave the other person feeling like your feedback isn’t directly applicable to them. Include direct statements about their performance.
Be sincere. Don’t compliment someone just for the sake of it. You risk coming off as phony and damaging your credibility. Find something that you honestly feel the person did well to talk about.
End with an encouraging statement. You will also wrap up your talk by offering some additional positive words. This is the second piece of bread in the feedback sandwich. This helps ensure that the conversation ends on a positive note.
